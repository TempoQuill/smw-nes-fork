# SMW-NES-Disassembly
This is a very WIP disassembly of the unlicensed Dendy port of SMW. We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/3rJSuzqzmE) if you want to assist with the disassembly or documentation.

# How to assemble
- Drag and drop your ROM onto the Python script `smw_nes_extractor.py` or run the script and enter your ROM's filename. This will dump the game's assets.
- Run either "assemble.bat" or "assemble.sh", depending on your OS.
(The assembler used can be found [here](https://github.com/morskoyzmey/asm6).)

# To-do:
- Better document some of the collision and object code.
- Finish fixing the labels, cleaning, and organizing the music ASM. As of right now, they're extremely messy.
