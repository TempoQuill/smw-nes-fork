# SMW-NES-Disassembly
This is a very WIP hack of the disassembly of the unlicensed Dendy port of SMW. We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/3rJSuzqzmE) if you want to assist with the disassembly, documentation or modifications.
Updates to this project are likely to be quite slow due to time and motivation but it is being worked on.

# How to assemble
- Drag and drop your ROM onto the Python script `smw_nes_extractor.py` or run the script and enter your ROM's filename. This will dump the game's assets.
- Run either "assemble.bat" or "assemble.sh", depending on your OS.
(The assembler used can be found [here](https://github.com/morskoyzmey/asm6).)

# Current WIP task:
These changes are not currently in the available build as they are not in a viable state yet .\
New player animation routines, data format, data, sprites and sprite mappings are being worked on. This is a fairly involved modification and will take some time .\
A changelog will be included soon 

# Known Issues:
Known issues with current modifications are: .\

# To-do:
-General optimisation to the engine, this thing is slow and inefficient in many ways .\
-fix new missing collision issue with some bosses .\
-fix Yoshi Coin bug .\
-fix fireball cape switch crash .\
-fix weirdness with grabbing onto edges of fences .\
-replace physics routines (big task) 

- Better document some of the collision and object code.
- Finish fixing the labels, cleaning, and organizing the music ASM. As of right now, they're extremely messy.
